# AndroidExcercise
1.In this application I have followed MVP  pattern.

2.I have used Retrofit to fetch the data from remote server.

3.I have used picasso for image displaying

4.I have used RecyclerView instead of traditional Listview since RecyclerView will  give better performace.

5.I have applied custom fonts.

6.I found that for some of the items the image url  is empty or url does not work, Here If there no image image I am displaying a placeholder image.

7.Implemented pull down to refrech feature

8.Added 3 test cases like  check app  context, check RecyclerView displayed or not, scorll to a position in RecyclerView.
